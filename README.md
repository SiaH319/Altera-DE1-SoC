# Altera-DE1-SoC

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

#### Basic ARM assembly
This part shows the basics of ARM assembly by programming some common routine by implementing the following content: compare instructions, branch instructions, shift instructions, load and store instructions, subroutines and function calls. <br> <br> 



#### IO and Timers

This section introduces the basic I/O capabilities of the DE1-SoC computer, such as the slider switches, pushbuttons, LEDs, 7-Segment displays and timers (both polling and interrup based). <br> <br>


#### VGA and PS2

This part shows th high level I/O capabilities of the DE1-SoC simulator to (1) display pixels and characters using the VGA controller, (2)  and accept keyboard input via the PS/2 port.  <br> <br>

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
The overall project is based on ARMv7 assembly code with DE1-SoC computer. <br>
The emulated DE1-SoC Computer System can be found here: [DE1-SoC simulator](http://ecse324.ece.mcgill.ca/simulator/?sys=arm-de1soc) <br>
The following is the The authoritative resource on these matters: [DE1-SoC Computer Manual](DE1-SoC_Computer_ARM.pdf)
